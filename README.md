# 09 Node.js Challenge: Jenny Naoroji's Professional README Generator

## Description

My task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on their project.

## Usage

The application will be invoked by using the following command in the command line:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Screenshot

The following screenshot shows my web application's appearance and functionality:
